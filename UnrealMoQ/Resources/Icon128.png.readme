# Plugin Icon

This directory should contain the plugin icon:
- Icon128.png (128x128 pixels) - Main plugin icon shown in the Plugins window

The icon should be a PNG file with transparency support, representing the UnrealMoQ plugin.

## Suggested Icon Design

- Theme: Network/streaming/media icon
- Colors: Blue and white (matching Unreal Engine theme)
- Style: Modern, clean, professional
- Elements: Could include "MoQ" text, network nodes, or streaming waves

To add the icon:
1. Create or design a 128x128 PNG image
2. Save it as `Resources/Icon128.png`
3. The plugin will automatically use it in the Unreal Engine Plugins window
